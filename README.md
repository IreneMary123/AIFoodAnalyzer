Project Description
NutriVision AI is an AI-powered web application that analyzes uploaded food images to estimate their nutritional content and provides personalized health suggestions based on the user’s fitness goal.

The Problem statement
People often struggle to track what they eat and estimate nutritional content. Manual tracking is tedious, and existing apps are not always accurate or convenient.

The Solution
NutriVision AI allows users to upload a photo of their meal and instantly receive calorie estimates, macronutrient breakdowns, and health suggestions tailored to their fitness goal.
